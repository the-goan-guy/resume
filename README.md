## Usage

Fork this repo, edit the `Resume.md` file under the folder src. This is built using React, so clone the forked report and run `npm install` to install all dev and prod dependencies.

### Changing the styles

CSS is written according to the default markdown elements like headers and lists. The styling is still work in progress, feel free to suggest changes. To insert a page break for the print version, add a `<hr>` tag or markdown notation `---` to the file.

## Deployment

You can use deploy this as a GitHub page by running `npm run deploy` (provided you have your git credentials configured) which will be deployed at _githubusername.github.io/resume_ (or if you have a custom domain then _vishwas.tech/resume/_ ).

Or you can use sites like Netlify or Zeit to deploy from your Github repo.
